# Pokémon Pokédex and Team Builder React Project

# Project Description
This is my first React project, designed to combine my passion for Pokémon with web development. The application serves as a comprehensive tool for Pokémon players, offering both a detailed Pokédex and a Team Builder.

# Key Features:
- Pokédex:
  - Displays all 1,025 Pokémon with their types, individual stats, and sprites.
  - Includes detailed Pokémon views with bar graphs for easy comparison of stats.
- Team Builder:
  - Allows users to create teams and view their collective damage effectiveness.
  - Saves teams locally using local storage, enabling persistence across sessions.

# How to Use
Access the live website via [GitHub Pages](https://numairj.github.io/react-pokemon-website/#/Pokedex).

# Future Enhancements
In the future, I aim to:
- Add regional, mega and misc forms of pokemon.
- Improve the responsive design of the Team Builder for better usability on all devices.
- Optimize first load times to enhance user experience.
- Refactor code into reusable components and functions for better modularity and maintainability.
